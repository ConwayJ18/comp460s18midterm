Repo: https://github.com/ConwayJ18/comp460s18final/

Contents:

MillerRabin.java — Runs the MillerRabin primality test
SemiPrime.java — Checks for semi-primality using MillerRabin then brute-force
Driver.java — Can be used to run both tests at once, for as many numbers as necessary

To run tests in Driver:
1) Run Driver.java
2) Type in any integer value, press enter
2.a) This will return the results of both tests on that number
3) Repeat as many times as desired, then type "0" to quit.
